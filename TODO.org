* Features
** Client errors: reuse or mirror Errno
** Review Tautch and Tattach w/ afid = -1 and not; and caching of auth results
** Namespacing
*** FlagFields out of Topen
*** Messages under NonoP::Messages
** Socket IO
*** Version/auth decoder: only accepts those packets and upgrades the decoder
*** Separate client and server decoders: client rejects T messages, server rejects R messages
** Per export auth
*** DONE Tauth allows Tattach
*** DONE ACL hook
** Docs
*** README
*** Examples
**** Hash defined w/ in program variables
**** NonoP::FileSystem subclassing

*** Links
*** xattrs
*** Pipes
**** mkfifo
**** IO
**** In process virtual pipes
*** Devices
**** mknod
**** Pass throughbof major, minor
**** Direct IO
*** DOING Test suite of every request against each file system provider.
**** Generated table of support and testing state
** EasyFS integration: FUSE and 9p file systems.
** Benchmarks & standard file system tests
** File system quirk hiding
*** Temporary files for saves

** Proxy to another server
** Drop in embedded server
** Read & write requests larger than the allowed message size
*** Client side: Their handlers should remain until all the data has been accounted.
*** Server: handle requests w/ large counts

* Bugs
** DONE stray: ~Error on #<NonoP::Server::Connection [::ffff:127.0.0.1]:50988> TypeError: no implicit conversion of NonoP::Server::Connection into Integer~
